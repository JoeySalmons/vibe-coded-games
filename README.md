# Vibe Coded Game Collection

A collection of small, single-file games and applications created using AI-assisted "vibe coding." All projects run directly in any modern web browser.

## What is Vibe Coding?
"Vibe coding is a term for writing code by using natural language prompts to an AI, focusing on the desired outcome rather than the specific code implementation. It's a fast-prototyping method that involves an iterative feedback loop of describing what you want, seeing the AI's output, and refining the instructions based on the results."

## Compatibility
These games are built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should run on any modern browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge). The games are not intended for mobile or small screens, so they may not display properly.

## Vibe Coding Process
These games were made with a combination of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5. I alternated between them for brainstorming ideas and generating/updating the games. The only parts of code I manually added or changed were for minor balance adjustments.
