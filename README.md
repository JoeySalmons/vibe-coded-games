# Vibe Coded Game Collection

A collection of small, single-file games created using AI-assisted "vibe coding." All games run directly in any modern web browser.

## What is Vibe Coding?
"Vibe coding is a term for writing code by using natural language prompts to an AI, focusing on the desired outcome rather than the specific code implementation. It's a fast-prototyping method that involves an iterative feedback loop of describing what you want, seeing the AI's output, and refining the instructions based on the results."

## The Games

### **1. Ephemeral Echoes (v2.1)**

An atmospheric idle game where you generate currency by clicking and tracing patterns on a canvas. Use the currency to buy structures that automate production. Equip schematic items and "Sublimate" (prestige) to earn permanent upgrades for future runs.

### **2. Solarized Clicker: Singularity (v3.2)**

A classic idle clicker game inspired by *Cookie Clicker*. Click the main icon to generate cookies, then spend them on buildings to automate production. Hunt for randomly appearing Golden Cookies to get temporary boosts and purchase upgrades to increase your output.

### **3. The Infinite Content Machine (v4.2)**

A narrative idle game where you play as an AI designed to capture human attention. Automate content generation to progress through story phases, unlocking new upgrades and advancing the dark sci-fi plot. Prestige by "Entering a Simulation" to earn a permanent production bonus.

### **4. Pirate Fleet Commander (v3.0)**

A top-down fleet management and exploration game. Control your flagship to explore a procedurally generated sea, engaging in real-time combat with enemies. Collect loot from defeated ships and use it at island ports to buy new ships and upgrade your fleet.

## Compatibility
These games are built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should run on any modern browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) on desktop or mobile. No installation is required. The games are not intended for mobile or small screens, so they may not display properly.

## Vibe Coding Process
These games were made with a combination of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5. I alternated between them for brainstorming ideas and generating the games.
